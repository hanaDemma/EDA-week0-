Streamlit Dashboard for Solar and Wind Data Analysis

This project is a Streamlit dashboard designed to analyze and visualize data related to solar radiation, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. The app allows users to upload CSV files, explore data trends, and visualize various components such as hourly and monthly averages, wind direction distributions, and correlation matrices for solar and temperature data.

Features
Data Upload: Upload your CSV files containing solar and wind data.
Monthly Trends: Visualize monthly trends for solar radiation components (GHI, DNI, DHI) and temperature (Tamb).
Hourly Averages: Explore hourly trends for solar radiation and temperature.
Sensor Readings: Compare sensor readings for cleaned and not-cleaned data.
Correlation Matrix: Display a heatmap showing the correlation between solar radiation components and temperature.
Wind Direction Distribution: Analyze wind direction using a polar bar chart.
Wind Speed Distribution: Visualize the distribution of wind speed using a radial bar chart.

Usage
Upload a CSV file with the required columns (see CSV Data Requirements).
Choose one of the available options from the sidebar to visualize trends:
Data Upload: Upload and preview the first few rows of your CSV file.
Monthly Trends: View monthly averages for solar radiation and temperature.
Hourly Averages: Display hourly averages of solar radiation components and temperature.
Sensor Readings: Compare cleaned and not-cleaned sensor readings.
Correlation Matrix: Display a heatmap for solar radiation and temperature correlation.
Wind Direction Distribution: View the wind direction distribution using a polar plot.
Wind Speed Distribution: Explore the wind speed distribution using a radial bar plot.
CSV Data Requirements
Your CSV file should contain the following columns for accurate analysis and visualization:

Timestamp: A column named Timestamp with time data in a recognizable format.
Solar Data: Columns like GHI, DNI, DHI for solar radiation data.
Temperature: Columns like Tamb, TModA, TModB for temperature data.
Wind Data: Columns like WD (Wind Direction), WS (Wind Speed).
Sensor Data: Columns like ModA, ModB, Cleaning for sensor readings.
Example CSV Format:
Timestamp	GHI	DNI	DHI	Tamb	TModA	TModB	WD	WS	ModA	ModB	Cleaning
2024-01-01 00:00:00	500	200	150	25	23	24	180	10	200	210	1
